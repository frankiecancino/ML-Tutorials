    "Linear regression is one of the fundamental tools for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. We reference the equation `y = mx + b` in the \"What is Machine Learning?\" post, which can be thought of as the basis of linear regression. Linear regression models are highly explainable, quick to train, can provide insights into your data, and be further optimized to make better predictions. If you're just starting out with data science or machine learning, it's  a good idea to dive into linear regression to get an understanding of how data can be estimated using functions."

    "The formula is very similar! Instead of `y = mx + b`, with Linear Regression we typically write the equation as: $$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x_1 + \\beta_2 * x_2 ... + \\beta_n * x_n + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Let's take a look at the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is y?\n",
    "We still have `y` just like in `y = mx + b`, which is the output. This is the y-axis value you care about and want to find what columns or features impact it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is $ \\beta_0 $?\n",
    "We also have $ \\beta_0 $, pronounced \"Beta Not\", and think of this as the y-intercept which is found as `b` in `y = mx + b`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about the $ \\beta x $ stuff?\n",
    "Now that you know we have `y` and `b` from `y = mx + b` that leaves us with `mx`. If you guessed, this is what we are seeing with the $ \\beta x $ or the Betas with their corresponding x's. The Betas are like the slopes or `m` in `y = mx + b`. The x's are the inputs from the data. An example of `x` can be marketing dollars you put into a project and then you want `y` to tell you approximately how much revenue you get out of it. Since in linear regression and machine learning we typically have more than one `x` or column of data to help us determine its relationship with `y`, we also have many Betas to pair with those many `x`'s. This would be like if you had multiple `mx`'s in your `y = mx + b` equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what are the Betas exactly?\n",
    "As for $ \\beta $ these are what are called the coefficients. These are very important and essentially explain your model. These are the weights and learned values from linear regression which tell you how much each feature or column impacts your prediction or y-axis variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Okay, then what's that last greek letter $ \\epsilon $ at the end?\n",
    "That greek letter is epsilon. This essentially says you will have some unexplained error in your model. Another way of putting it is that you probably won't be able to explain everything going on in your data with this short equation, so we throw $ \\epsilon $ there at the end to signify that there is just some error or noise going on we can't explain right now."

You can look at coefficients and attempt to learn what data is impacting your model. You can use Linear Regression as a baseline tool to determine if other models may be better. Linear Regression is quick to train and doesn't require a lot of data. Although, in many cases it can be too simple. Therefore, don't count out more complex methods or additional methods to make your linear model better!"
